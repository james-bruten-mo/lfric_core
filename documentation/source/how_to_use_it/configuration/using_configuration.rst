.. _using configuration:

Configuration code generation
=============================

Applications that use the :ref:`extended Rose metadata <extended rose
metadata>` can run the LFRic :ref:`Configurator <configurator>` as
part of the application build process. The Configurator generates all
the code required to read namelist configuration files. The code also
makes the configuration information available to application coders in
a user-friendly format.

This section describes how to load an application configuration into
the application, and how code can use the various types of application
configuration.

Loading the configuration
=========================

The Configurator generates a procedure, ``read_configuration``, to
read a namelist configuration file. Each namelist configuration is
stored in a ``namelist_type`` object. All the ``namelist_type``
objects are stored in a ``namelist_collection_type`` object.

.. code-block:: fortran

  use configuration_mod, only: read_configuration

  type(namelist_collection_type) :: configuration

  <snip>

  call read_configuration( namelist_file, configuration )

The LFRic infrastructure provides a :ref:`driver configuration
component<driver configuration>` that orchestrates both reading of the
namelist configuration file and cross-checking the contents to ensure
all required namelists are present. The driver configuration component
can be used instead of directly calling the above procedure.

.. _configuration object:

Using the Configuration Object
==============================

The term "configuration object" refers to an object of type
``namelist_collection_type``. It holds a number of ``namelist_type``
objects each of which holds the configuration choices for one of the
namelists. To access a namelist object, call the ``get_namelist``
function on the namelist name:

.. code-block:: fortran

  use namelist_mod, only: namelist_type
  use namelist_collection_mod, only : namelist_collection_type

  type(namelist_collection_type) :: configuration

  type(namelist_type), pointer :: base_mesh_nml

  base_mesh_nml => configuration%get_namelist('base_mesh')

Then use the ``get_value`` function of the ``namelist_type`` object to
get the configuration value of a variable:

.. code-block:: fortran

  character(str_def) :: mesh_name

  call base_mesh_nml%get_value('mesh_name', mesh_name)

Enumerations
------------

An enumeration is a variable that can take one of a small number of
fixed values. In the namelist the permitted values are strings, but
within the code, the option and each of the permitted values are
converted into integers.

To get, and to use, an enumeration, one has to get the value
representing the choice, but also one or more of the enumeration list
to check against. Enumerations are stored as ``i_def`` integers. The
enumeration options are parameters that can be obtained directly from
Configurator-generated ``_config_mod`` modules.

To illustrate, Rose metadata can configure the value of the
``geometry`` variable in the namelist so that it can be either the
string "spherical" or the string "planar". In the following code, is
checked against two allowed choices of geometry: ``spherical`` and
``planar``, referenced by the two integer parameters in the
``base_mesh_config_mod`` module. The names of the parameters are
prefixed with the name of the variable to ensure there is no
duplication of parameter names with other enumeration variables:

.. code-block:: fortran

   use base_mesh_config_mod, only: geometry_spherical, geometry_planar

   integer(i_def) :: geometry_choice
   real(r_def)    :: domain_bottom

   base_mesh_nml => configuration%get_namelist('base_mesh')
   call base_mesh_nml%get_value('geometry', geometry_choice)

   select case (geometry_choice)
   case (geometry_planar)
     domain_bottom = 0.0_r_def
   case (geometry_spherical)
     domain_bottom = earth_radius
   case default
     call log_event("Invalid geometry", LOG_LEVEL_ERROR)
   end select

.. admonition:: Hidden values

  Use of enumerations can be better than using numerical options or
  string variables.

  A parameter name is more meaningful and memorable than a numerical
  option, making code more readable. There is also a clearer link
  between the name and the metadata, as the metadata can be easily
  searched to find information about the option.

  Code that compares integer options and parameters is safer than code
  that compares string options and parameters. If there are spelling
  errors in the names in the code, the former will fail at compile
  time whereas problems with the latter only arise at run-time.

Duplicating namelists
---------------------

Where namelists are duplicated, the possible values of the instance
variable can be used to distinguish between them. For example, for a
namelist ``partitioning`` with an instance key of ``mesh_choice``,
the relevant parts of the Rose metadata may look as follows::

  [namelist:partitioning]
  duplicate=true
  instance_key_member=mesh_choice

  [namelist:partitioning=mesh_choice]
  !enumeration=true
  values='source', 'destination'

As the instance key is ``mesh_choice``, there may be two copies of the
namelist each with a different ``mesh_choice``::

  &partitioning
  mesh_choice           = 'destination',
  partitioner           = 'cubedsphere',
  panel_decomposition   = 'auto',
  /

  &partitioning
  mesh_choice           = 'source',
  partitioner           = 'planar',
  panel_decomposition   = 'auto',
  /

The different namelist options can be extracted with the following
code (noting that the possible ``mesh_choice`` strings must be known
in the code):

.. code-block:: fortran

  ! Get namelist objects for the source and destination partitioning
  source_partitioning_nml =>                             &
              configuration%get_namelist('partitioning', &
                                         'source')
  destination_partitioning_nml =>                        &
              configuration%get_namelist('partitioning', &
                                         'destination')

  ! Extract information from the two different namelist objects
  call source_partitioning_nml%get_value('partitioner',       &
                                          source_partitioner)
  call destination_partitioning_nml%get_value('partitioner',  &
                                          destination_partitioner)

.. _config_mod files:

Using config_mod files
======================

In the examples above, the ``config_mod`` files were used only to
obtain the parameters that represent the options of an enumeration
variable.

It is normally possible to obtain any variables direct from the
``config_mod`` files rather than going through the configuration
object functions. However, this method cannot work where namelists are
duplicated. Namelists can be duplicated by metadata definition as
described above, in which case values are distinguished by a key
variable.

But applications can also be required to read two separate namelist
configurations where the same namelist appears in both. In these
cases, the application can load each configuration into two separate
configuration objects. This means that different parts of the
application can be passed different configuration objects, and the
data in the configuration object will be specific for that part of the
application. While the parameter values that define enumerator options
will be the same for both parts of the application, the values for the
first namelist in the ``config_mod`` file will be overwritten by the
second namelist to be read in.

In the following example, the same requirement as the example above is
met by directly using the value of the ``geometry`` option from the
``config_mod`` file:

.. code-block:: fortran

   use base_mesh_config_mod, only: geometry_spherical, &
                                   geometry_planar,    &
                                   geometry

   real(r_def)    :: domain_bottom

   select case (geometry)
   case (geometry_planar)
     domain_bottom = 0.0_r_def
   case (geometry_spherical)
     domain_bottom = earth_radius
   case default
     call log_event("Invalid geometry", LOG_LEVEL_ERROR)
   end select

The ``default`` case would cause an error if ``geometry`` has not been
set or if it has been set to another valid value that is not supported
by this part of the code.
