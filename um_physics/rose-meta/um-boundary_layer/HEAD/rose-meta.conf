    =been 5.0 but the LES of Beare (2008) together with UKV case
    =studies suggest a lower value would be more appropriate
    =(Beare gives 1.6).

    =removing the stability dependence entirely (so that the neutral
    =value is used) and those described as the "standard" and "conventional"
    =subgrid models in the LES of Brown (1999). The conventional model gives
    =significantly less mixing than the standard LEM,
    =and the standard LEM gives very similar momentum mixing to the original
    =UM but has a significantly larger Prandtl number in the convective
    =limit (0.44 vs 0.14). Selection of any LEM stable or unstable function
    =will also impose a neutral Prandtl number of 0.7

description=Shear driven BL diagnosis options
!enumeration=true
help=In situations where surface conditions are close to neutral and the

    =the thermodynamic parcel ascent diagnosis of both cumulus and
    =non-local boundary layers are over-ruled to leave turbulent mixing
    =to be determined by the local Richardson number scheme only.
    ="zi/L used over sea" gives problems when BL_LEVELS is high,
    =therefore "zi/L revised over sea" corrects this.
    ="zi/L used in Cumulus over sea" applies this only to points
    =diagnosed with Cumulus and strictly for sea points (fland<0.01,
    =cf 0.5).
    ="Ri based" also overrides Cumulus diagnosis if
    =Zh(Ri) > Zlcl+zhloc_depth_fac*(Zhpar-Zlcl).
    =Note that here Ri accounts for gradient adjustment by the
    =non-local scheme. This option further restricts a Cumulus diagnosis
    =to allow for disruption of cumulus formation through vertical wind
    =shear (diagnosed through a sub-critical Richardson number profile
    =extending well into the cloud layer). Under these circumstances the
    =non-local boundary layer scheme is allowed to mix up to the original
    =parcel ascent top.

    =Additionally,
    =for all options (other than 0) the consistency of the provisional
    =diagnosis of an unstable boundary layer in CONV_DIAG is checked
    =against the surface flux diagnosed by the surface exchange routines.

    =resolved their effects on vertical mixing (through induced wind shear)
    =should be included. Two independent methods to do this have been coded.
    =Currently these require the orographic stress (LAND_SURF panel) and GWD
    =schemes to be switched on in order to have the necessary ancillary
    =fields loaded. The subgrid shear options currently convert these into
    =a mean slope using an empirical relationship derived for the UKV only,
    =and so this is not recommended for any other model. These options
    =include the shear in the calculation of the Richardson number and
    =diffusion coefficients,
