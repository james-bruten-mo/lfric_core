Parameterized advective transport includes processes such as parameterized mesoscale and submesoscale transport, as well as any other advectively parameterized transport. When the parameterized advective transport is represented in the model as a skew-diffusion rather than an advection, then the parameterized skew diffusion should be included in this diagnostic, since the convergence of skew-fluxes are identical (in the continuous formulation) to the convergence of advective fluxes.",
